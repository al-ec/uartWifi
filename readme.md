### A simple, semi-transparent serial bridge for an ESP8266 module. Send/recieve information via serverArgs, easily adpating to any native mobile or desktop application.

This is totally a work in progress, I'd highly advise not to use this... yet.

If you're not seeing any install instructions or config help on the readme, then the code is not ready for any beta or production use.
